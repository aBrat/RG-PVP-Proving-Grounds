=RG= Mission Template
===============
This repository contains the mission template for Reality Gaming, a gaming community.   
This is not intended as a finished mission, but is here as a collaborative tool  
for the bare bones mission template for mission makers of the community to build from.  

What it contains
===============
The Taskforce unit structure.
Common modules with predefined settings

Different factions  
===============  
Currently we have two different factions:  
_WD is woodland camouflage units  
_DS is desert camouflage units  
_SN is winter camouflage units

The classnames differ only by the suffix.  
This makes it easy to change the unit from one faction to another using a simple search and replace.  
You can convert the _WD units into _DS (or other way around) easily with search and replace in the mission.sqm-file.  


ALiVE Multispawn
===============
The Mission template now features ALiVE Multispawn module.  
Read about the usage here: http://alivemod.com/wiki/index.php/Multispawn  
There are numerous markers on the map designating these points per faction.  
Used respawn types are in the functionality order:  
-Building  
-Faction  
-Fallback to vanilla system  

Vanilla respawn system
===============
Vanilla respawn system only works as a fallback in the case of all ALiVE respawn points not working.
The marker for vanilla respawn: "respawn_west" is located near the ALiVE multispawn markers and it`s called "Fallback Respawn".  
For info on vanilla respawn systems: https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Arma_3_Respawn

Required Modules  
===============
Alive, Zeus, AGM, Game Logic, Headless client
These should stay pretty much the same - configure if you need a specific result
===============
Scripts are initialized from different locations:  
-Init.sqf  
-InitPlayerLocal.sqf  
-initPlayerServer.sqf  
-InitServer.sqf  
-scripts\XEH_Init\typeof.sqf

Functions
===============
There are numerous functions built into the template.  
You can browse them at missionroot/functions folder or ingame with [functions library](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Functions_Library_(Arma_3))/missionConfigFile

Headless Client
===============
There is also a headless client slot.  
It exists there only as a placeholder as we don't have a HC setup currently running.
